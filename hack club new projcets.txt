Project idea brainstorm:


AI
Problem people have:
AI plagiarism
Too slow
Over explain
Timing events with friends
Timing meetings with co-workers
Buying things online 
Buying clothes online without knowing size (different standards in different countries)
Finding new hobbies (tinker for hobbies?)
Best sitting position
Stalker / sexual harassment detection -> camera computer vision 




Ideas:
Website chatbot -> on personal website?
AI that allows you to explore hobbies
Ai that deterimines best sitting position from picture of desk
* Inputs phone picture of desk
* 3d model of human 
   * Red parts to show strained muscles
* 3d model of desk
* Instructions on how to move body to best suit long term sitting




Ergonomics AI
1. Phone take picture (android implantation?) 
   1. Open CV 
   2. Use YOLO to detect human and desk
   3. Segmentation to divide human and desk and background
2. Pose generation:
   1. PoseNet / OpenPose to detect post
   2. Outputs json file (?)
3. AI prediction of strained parts
   1. ???
   2. Open source model
      1. https://github.com/BehnooshParsa/HumanActionRecognition_with_ErgonomicRisk 
4. Visualization
   1. Matplotlib human heat map
      1. Each string in the AI output corresponds to body part
      2. Also shows percentage of strain
      3. Matplotlib heat map generation
5. AI recommendations 
   1. Insert at risk body parts
   2. Prompt eng ideal ergonomic positions
   3. text output recommendations
6. UI
   1. HTML + CSS + JS front end
   2. Flask backend
   3.
